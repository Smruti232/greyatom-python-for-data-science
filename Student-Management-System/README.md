### Project Overview

 This project  is an overview how to creat a student management system using python.


### Learnings from the project

 This project helped me to llearn how to use variables , lists, touples ,dictionaries etc and how to perform different actions on these using arithmatic ,logical and relational operators .


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Learning the basics of python programming language in detail and applying it to solve the probles faced in the project. Breaking down  the whole project into different parts and the solving each part using the conceptual knowledge of the python language.


### Challenges faced

 While finding the highest mark in mathematics from the dictionary created from the name of the students and their respective marks in mathematics wasn't difficult , printing the name of the topper student in the output by fetching the name (which was the key element in the dictonary) from the dictonary ,was the problem i faced during writing the codes for the project . Solved the probem by again going through the lesson thoroughly and learning how to access the key element name from the dictonary in python.
